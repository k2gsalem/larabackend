Build me a secure and scalable multi-tenant SaaS backend using Laravel 11.

Requirements:

Use stancl/tenancy for multi-tenant (multi-database) architecture.

Use Laravel Sanctum for API authentication (token-based).

Add role and permission control with spatie/laravel-permission.

Add Stripe or Razorpay for subscription management using Laravel Cashier.

All sensitive data should use env variables or Doppler, not hard-coded values.

Write clean, PSR-12-compliant PHP code and separate logic into Services and Controllers.

Use form requests for validation, resource transformers for API responses, and policy classes for access control.

Protect against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, mass assignment, and insecure file uploads.

Use Redis for queues and cache.

Dockerize the app with Nginx + PHP-FPM + MySQL + Redis.

Include unit and feature tests for tenant creation, authentication, and billing.

Add logging and error handling using Monolog and Sentry.

Optimize queries with indexes and use pagination on API endpoints.

Generate API documentation (OpenAPI / Swagger) automatically.

Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD and deploy on AWS ECS (Fargate) or Laravel Vapor.

🧠 Optional Add-On

If you want frontend + mobile later:

Then also build Next.js 15 + Tailwind CSS frontend and React Native + Expo mobile app that connect to this Laravel API securely via HTTPS with JWT tokens.
